Find  --- this command is used to find the files and directories.

       find /home -name '*.txt' --- finds all the text files in /home directory and all of its subdirectories.

       find /home -iname '*.TXT' --- to make it case insensitive we will use -i.

       find /home -maxdepth 2 -name '*.txt' --- to limit the search to 2 levels only i.e /home and its immideate 
       subdirectory.
       find /home -type f -name '*.txt' --- limit the search only to file type.

       find /home -name '*.txt' -mtime -7 --- find files which are modified within 7days.

       find /home -name '*.txt' -mtime +30 -- find files which are modified over 30 days.

       find /home -name '*.txt' -size +1M --- find files larger than 1megabytes.

       find /home -name '*.txt' -size -10k -- find files smaller than 10 kilobytes.

       find /home -name '*.txt' -exec rm -v {} \; -- find the txt files and delete. -exec will execute the rm(remove) command on the files. -v makes rm to print the file name after each deletion. {} is a placeholder for filename. \ terminates the command. 

       find /home -name '*.txt' -exec grep -l "error" {} \; --- prints the file names which containing error.

       find /home -name '*.txt' -exec gzip {} \; --- Gzips the txt files individually.

       find /home -name '*.txt' -exec chmod 755 {} \; -- makes all files executable.

       find /home -name '*.txt' -exec cp {} /backup \;  -- all the txt files will be copied to backup.

       find /home -name '*.txt' -ok rm -v {} \;   --- it will ask before each deletion. so it is better to use -ok instead of -exec for deletion.

      find /home -name '*.txt' -print0 | xargs -0 rm -v --- here it will find all the .txt files and -print0 is a special output format which uses NULL character(\0) as a seperator for the filenames instead of newline. These will be passed to the xargus as an input. the xargs converts the input into command argument. -0 tells the xargs to accept the NULL seperated input (matches to -print0). --- this commands work faster than the exec rm , because it groups multiple filenames into single argument and execute the rm command once on them.
