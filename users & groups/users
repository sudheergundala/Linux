Linux is a multi user operating system, where multiple users can work simutaniously. Every user has thier own account, home directory and also set of permissions to perform the operations.
In linux, there are 3 types of users.
  1. Super User (root) -- Has Administrative provilages and can do anything in the system. 
  2. Normal User -- Created by the administrator according to the requirment. Has least privilages.
  3. System User.  -- created by system

These users have the IDs in the below range.
   1. Root User -- UID - 0
   2. Normal Users -- UID - 1000 +
   3. System Users -- UID - 1 - 999

These ranges are defined in /etc/login.defs. if you want to change any of the min and max values of of the above users you can do in here.

3 important configuration files for users and groups are
   1. /etc/passwd  --- stores user account info(user name. userid, groupid, home directory,shell)
   2. /etc/shadow --- stores encrypted passwords.
   3. /etc/group  --- stores group info.

User Management commands:

  1. adduser/useradd --  this will create the user.
        adduser -- this is more user interactive command. Here it will create the user's home directory and copies default config files from /etc/skel.
                   ii. This will prompt to create the password, full name etc.
                   iii. It is by default available in debian distributions.
        useradd -- this is a low level command that directly interacts with /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow, where it will just create the user.
                   ii. Here we need to create the user's home directory by using mkdir or -m option while using the useradd command (useradd -m john).
                   iii. we also need to create the password explicitly (passwd john).
                   iv. It is available on all the linux distributions.
                   v. It is best for scripting and automation.
